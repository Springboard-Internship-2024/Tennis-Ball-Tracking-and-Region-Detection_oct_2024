Quickstart Guide

1. Clone the Repository

git clone <repository-url>
cd yolov5

2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.8 or higher). Then install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Prepare the Model

Place your trained YOLOv5 model weights (best.pt) in the specified directory:

yolov5/runs/exp/weights/best.pt

4. Run the Streamlit App

Navigate to the yolov5 directory and launch the application:

streamlit run app.py
