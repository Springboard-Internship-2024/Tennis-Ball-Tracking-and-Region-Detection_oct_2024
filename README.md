## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd yolov5
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

Ensure Python is installed. Then, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Prepare the Model

Place your trained YOLOv5 model weights (`best.pt`) in the directory:

```
yolov5/runs/exp/weights/best.pt
```

### 4️⃣ Launch the Application

Run the following command to start the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
